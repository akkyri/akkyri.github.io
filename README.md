Paramore was originally formed in 2004 in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. The members then were vocalist Hayley Williams, drummer Zac Farro,. The name "Paramore" came from the name of their first bassist's mother. When they learned the meaning of the word "paramour" (it means "secret lover"), they decided to use the name under Paramore spelling.

*Williams was discovered in 2003 by managers Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams, who signed the 14-year-old to a two-year production deal. At the time she was writing pop songs with songwriters in Nashville. Williams was introduced to Atlantic Records A&R Tom Storms through Richard Williams' attorneys Jim Zumwalt and Kent Marcus, and then signed to the label by Jason Flom. The label's original plan for their new artist was to make her a solo pop artist, but Williams objected to this, saying that she wanted to be part of a band and play pop punk music.*

## Zac Farro

*Farro, at age 14, was a founding member of Paramore, created in Franklin, Tennessee in 2004. Jeremy Davis admitted he was initially unsure if the band could be taken seriously because of Zac's young age until he saw him play. The band released three studio albums, All We Know Is Falling, Riot! and Brand New Eyes, as well as two live albums and one EP. Brand New Eyes, their third album, was released on September 29, 2009. In June 2009, the band welcomed Taylor York (rhythm guitar), a long time friend of the Farros' and who previously played with them as a touring member. On December 18, 2010, the band's website announced the Farros' amicable departure. On December 21, 2010, Josh Farro released an official exit statement for himself and his brother, refuting the band's previous story. Despite initially mentioning that he was only participating in the recording of their fifth album, it was confirmed on February 2, 2017, that Farro was back as the official drummer in the band.*

*York had been in a band with the Farro brothers (Josh and Zac) months before the two met Hayley Williams. Zac Farro introduced York to Williams at a high school football game, and they hit it off right away.York took part in writing songs such as "Conspiracy" for Paramore's debut album, All We Know Is Falling, and bonus track "O Star", which was the first song York wrote with Williams alone just after they met, when they were 12 and 13 years old. York has "officially" played with Paramore since 2007.*
